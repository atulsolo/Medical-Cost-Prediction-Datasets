Medical Cost Prediction Datasets

Overview
This repository provides datasets and resources for predicting medical costs using machine learning algorithms. Medical cost prediction is a crucial task in healthcare analytics, enabling stakeholders to estimate and manage healthcare expenses effectively. The datasets included here cover various factors that influence medical costs, such as age, BMI, region, smoker status, etc. These datasets are curated and preprocessed for ease of use in machine learning projects.

Datasets
Medical Cost Personal Datasets: This dataset contains information about patients including age, sex, BMI, number of children, smoker status, region, and medical costs billed by health insurance. Source
Healthcare Cost and Utilization Project (HCUP): HCUP provides a variety of databases, tools, and software for studying healthcare utilization and spending in the United States. Datasets cover hospital inpatient stays, emergency department visits, ambulatory surgery visits, and more. Source
National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES): NHANES is a program of studies designed to assess the health and nutritional status of adults and children in the United States. It provides demographic, health examination, and laboratory data. Source
IBM Watson Health's 100 Hospitals dataset: This dataset includes metrics such as the number of patients treated, the average length of stay, and the total cost. It provides insights into hospital performance and healthcare costs. Source
Usage
Data Exploration: Use Jupyter notebooks or any preferred data analysis tool to explore the datasets and understand the features.
Model Training: Train machine learning models using these datasets to predict medical costs based on various factors.
Evaluation: Evaluate model performance using metrics such as mean absolute error, mean squared error, etc.
Deployment: Deploy the trained models in healthcare systems or insurance companies for cost prediction and management.
